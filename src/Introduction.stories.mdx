# Get started

Factiverse Design System is a reusable component library that helps Factiverse contributors build UIs faster. The goal is to make building durable UIs more productive and satisfying.

## Install

FDS components are written in React, and its stories are written in [Component Story Format](https://medium.com/storybookjs/component-story-format-66f4c32366df). It requires Storybook version 5.2-beta and up.

Add SDS to your project.

    npm install --save @factiverse/design-system

## Use

Import components you want into your UI

    import { Button, Badge } from '@factiverse/design-system';

and use them like so

    const example = () => (
    <div>
      <Button appearance="primary" onClick={() => 0}>Do something</Button>
      <Badge onClick={this.clear}>Cool</Badge>
    </div>
    )

## Run and develop SDS locally

Clone the [FDS Github project](https://github.com/factiverse/storybook-design-system) then start Storybook.

    npm install && npm run storybook
